# socialNetwork_API

## Description
This is a RESTful API designed for a social media platform where users can share their thoughts, react to their friends' posts, and maintain a list of friends. It has been built using the powerful `Express.js` framework for easy and efficient routing, with a MongoDB database for seamless data storage, retrieval and manipulation, `Mongoose ODM` for smooth database communication, and `Moment.js` to ensure proper formatting of timestamps. The seed data used for testing and populating the database is created and managed using the popular API development tool, Insomnia. With this API, users can easily perform a wide range of CRUD operations on their thoughts, reactions and friends' lists, all from a user-friendly and well-documented interface.
